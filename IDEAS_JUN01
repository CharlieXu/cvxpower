-network has graph structure:
  -nodes called "nets" (or "buses"?)
  -edges called "links"?
-circuit analogy:
  -node potentials are prices
  -edge flows are (electric) power
  -edge 'power' (flow times potential difference) is economic value flow (in $)
-edges can dissipate power
  -power loss must be convex in power flow
  -allows for a cvx relaxation (tight if no power surplus)
-devices or edges can have temperature limits
  -follow a first-order system, input is power
-robustness handled by optimizing over multiple scenarios / contingencies
